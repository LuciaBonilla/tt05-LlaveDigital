# As everyone will have access to all designs, try to make it easy for someone new to your design to know what
# it does and how to operate it. This info will be automatically collected and used to make a datasheet for the chip.

  how_it_works: |
      This circuit allows to introduce a binary number of 4 bits.
      
      The LED of the output turn on with the sequence 1101.
      
      -With the first switch you select the value of the bit.
      
      -With the second switch (when it pass to 0 to 1) you send the selected bit to the sequence.

# Instructions on how someone could test your project, include things like what buttons do what and how to set the clock if needed
  how_to_test:  |
      -You make a clock click with the second switch of dip-switch-8.
      
      -For each clock click, the bit selected with the first switch is sent to the sequence.
      
      -You can see the sequence sent by observing the Yellow LEDs on (zero is off and one is on).
      
      -The Red LED turn on with the sequence 1101.
